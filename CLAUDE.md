# Pitching Lab

> Repo/Vercel project are still named `build-a-pitcher` internally (renaming risks breaking the
> link/deploys). **Player-facing brand is "Pitching Lab."**

## What this is
A browser game: spin a horizontal slot-machine reel of MLB pitchers, land on a random one, and
assign their rating to one of 9 body-mapped attribute slots on a pitcher figure. Fill all 9 →
weighted OVR → name your pitcher, pick a team, and **simulate their full career** → post to a
global/daily leaderboard.

- **Live:** https://pitchinglab.pitchergami.com (also `build-a-pitcher.vercel.app`)
- **Repo:** github.com/mattwolff1234-lab/build-a-pitcher (push to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys)
- **Ads:** Playwire (Ramp) — **read `ads.md` before touching page `<head>`s, layout, or
  `vercel.json`** (per-page ad-tag contract, dynamic ads.txt redirect, verification steps).

## NOT part of PitcherGami
Separate project from PitcherGami (~/pitcher-scorigami) and Perfect Season. Shared audience
(baseball fans), can cross-link, but separate codebase/db/deploy. Lives as a subdomain of
pitchergami.com purely for the "family of games" cross-promo; nothing is shared at runtime.

---

## Current state (shipped)

### Core loop
1. **Spin** the reel → it eases to a stop on a weighted-random pitcher (motion blur scales with
   reel speed; retro ticker SFX pitches down as it slows; cinematic reveal: light sweep + card pop).
2. **Land** → a card shows the pitcher; eligible body parts glow with a `+rating` preview.
3. **Assign** by tapping a body part → headshot flies into the slot, the body region washes in that
   player's team jersey color, OVR gauge counts up.
4. Repeat for all 9 slots → **finish** screen → name + pick team + **Simulate Career** → leaderboard.

### Power-ups (1 each per run)
- **Re-spin** — discard and spin again.
- **Boost** — upgrade the landed pitcher to their "Prime" (special-edition) version, then assign.
- **Snag** — take the pitcher one card to the **left or right** of where you landed.
- These stack on one slot (e.g. snag a neighbor, then boost that neighbor).

### The 9 slots (body-mapped on the figure)
| Slot | Source field | Body part | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Velocity | `pitch_velocity` | Bicep | |
| Break | `pitch_movement` | Wrist | |
| Strikeout | `k_per_bf` | Forearm | |
| Ground Ball | `hr_per_bf` | Ball (hand) | "keep ball in park" (HR suppression) |
| Command | `pitch_control` | Shoulder (throwing) | walk avoidance / location |
| Clutch | `pitching_clutch` | Head | |
| Defense | `fielding_ability` | Glove | |
| Frame | **height** (`heightIn`) | Body/torso | shows the height string (e.g. `6'4"`), taller = higher rating via `heightToRating` |
| Stamina | `stamina` | Legs | |

> Note: **Control/BB** (`bb_per_bf`) is the only old slot still removed — its field stays in
> `pitchers.json` but is unused (Command/`pitch_control` covers walk skill).

### Weighted OVR
`weightedOvr` = weighted avg of the 9 slot values: **1.2×** Strikeout, Ground Ball & Command (the
three true outcomes — K, HR, BB), **1.1×** Velocity/Break/Stamina/Clutch, **1.0×** Defense/Frame.
So slot placement is strategic.

### Tiers (border + glow colors)
Grey ≤64 · Bronze 65–74 · Silver 75–79 · Gold 80–84 · Diamond 85+ · **Legend = purple** (retired greats).

### The figure (2.5D, NOT real 3D)
Flat transparent silhouette `pitcher-figure.png` split into 9 feathered body-region masks
(`seg-<slotKey>.png`, softmax membership so colors blend, no hard seams). Each assigned region is
tinted to the player's team jersey color + `jersey-fabric.png` texture (overlay blend) + one global
soft-light `.shade`. Cursor-driven perspective tilt. **Per-body-part team jerseys require these flat
recolorable masks — that's why it's 2.5D, not a rigged 3D model.** Regenerate masks with the PIL
snippet in git history if anchors change (anchors live in the `SLOTS` array `ax/ay`).

### Look & feel
Broadcast/sports-HUD: Oswald (display/numbers) + Inter, animated stadium background (drifting
light blobs, scrolling perspective grid, scanlines), beveled HUD panels with cyan corner brackets,
OVR gauge ring + 9-pip draft tracker. All motion via **GSAP (CDN)**.

### Sound
Synthesized with the Web Audio API (no asset files): retro ticker, tier chimes (gold / diamond /
legend glory fanfare), Prime upgrade sweep, assign blip, whoosh, completion flourish. 🔊 mute toggle
in the header. Audio unlocks on first click (autoplay policy).

### Leaderboard
Reachable anytime from the ☰ menu (and auto-opens after you submit). **Global (all-time)** +
**Today** tabs, **top 200**, top-3 medal coloring. After submitting, your entry is **pinned at the
top with your exact rank even if you're outside the top 200**.

---

## Data source & pipeline
Attribute ratings (1–99) from the MLB The Show API: `mlb25.theshow.com/apis/items.json`
(primary) + `mlb26.theshow.com` (supplement: 2026 card replaces 2025 only if OVR is strictly
higher) + mlb24/23/22/21 gold+ historical. **When 2026 ratings mature mid-season and surpass 2025,
flip the primary to `mlb26` in both `fetch-data.js` and `fetch-batters.js`.**

- **`node fetch-data.js`** bakes `pitchers.json`:
  - Pool = **`series === "Live"` only** (real-world-accurate; special editions are inflated).
  - **SP + CP only** (relief pitchers `display_position === 'RP'` are dropped; legends exempt).
  - 2026 (current) = all tiers; 2025–2021 = **gold+ (OVR ≥ 80) historical** versions, tagged with year.
  - **Prime** map = highest-OVR special-edition card per player (Boost power-up). Don't say "MLB The
    Show" in the UI — call them "Prime."
  - **Legends** = retired greats (special card, no current Live card, OVR ≥ 85). Excluded by NAME if
    they have any prospect/showcase card (`PROSPECT_SERIES`, incl. Spring Breakout) — so hyped
    prospects like Konnor Griffin land in the Live pool (boostable), not as purple legends.
  - **Headshots** = MLB official (`midfield.mlbstatic.com/.../spots/180`) via name→MLBAM-id mapping
    (accent-stripped + people-search fallback). `node fetch-wiki-headshots.js` fills remaining ones
    from Wikipedia **with identity verification** (last name + first/nickname + "is a pitcher").
    ~21 deep prospects have no photo → neutral silhouette.
  - Frame needs `height`/`heightIn` (parsed from the API `height` string).

Re-run both scripts after any data refresh (the wiki script patches `img` fields onto `pitchers.json`,
so run it **after** `fetch-data.js`).

## Tech stack (actual)
- **Single static `index.html`**, no build step, no framework. GSAP via CDN. Data baked in
  `pitchers.json`; figure/segment/fabric PNGs are assets.
- **Leaderboard:** `api/score.js` — a **Vercel serverless function** (CommonJS; `package.json` has no
  `type:module` so the CJS build scripts keep working) → **Neon Postgres** via the Vercel↔Neon
  integration. Table `scores(id, name, ovr, build jsonb, created_at)` auto-creates on first request.
  Connection string is read prefix-agnostically (`DATABASE_URL`/`POSTGRES_URL`/`STORAGE_*`/ scan).
  - `GET /api/score?scope=global|daily&limit=200&me=<id>` → top-N rows + `me:{rank,name,ovr}` (the
    submitter's place in that scope, even if outside the top N). `POST /api/score {name, ovr, build}`
    → `{id, globalRank}`. `build` jsonb stores `{slots, career}`.
  - Global = by ovr; Daily = `created_at >= date_trunc('day', now())` (UTC).
- **Deploy:** Vercel (static + functions). Push to `main` auto-deploys. Neon env vars are
  **Sensitive** (can't be pulled to CLI). Domain `pitchinglab.pitchergami.com` (Vercel-managed DNS).

### Accounts + personal Hall of Fame (shipped)
**Sign in with Google** → save your created players to a personal, sortable **Hall of Fame**.
- **`api/account.js`** (Vercel serverless + same Neon DB). Tables `users(google_sub PK, email, name,
  picture, session_token)` and `saves(id, google_sub, game, name, ovr, build jsonb, created_at)`,
  auto-created. Browser gets a Google ID token (GSI), server verifies it via Google's `tokeninfo`
  endpoint (checks `aud === GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`), then issues our own `session_token` stored on the
  device. Actions: `login` / `save` / `delete` (POST) and `?action=list` (GET). One account spans
  both games; saves tagged by `game`.
- **Frontend** (both `index.html` + `build-a-batter.html`, near-identical): GSI script in head,
  account chip + "Sign in with Google" in the ☰ menu, "💾 Save to my Hall of Fame" button on the
  career-card screen, and a **🏛️ My Hall of Fame** menu tab — a GSAP-staggered, scrollable gallery
  of saved career cards with sort tabs (Overall/WAR/Earnings/HOF/Newest). Per-game constant:
  `HOF_GAME` (`'pitcher'` vs `'batter'`).
- **Setup:** `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is a placeholder (`REPLACE_WITH_…`) in 3 spots — both HTML files and
  `api/account.js` (or set env `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` for the server). Until it's a real OAuth Web client
  id (from console.cloud.google.com, with our domains as Authorized JS origins), `googleConfigured()`
  is false and the UI shows a "sign-in coming soon" hint instead of a broken button. The client id is
  public; the only secret-ish piece is the per-device session token.

### Player XP + Levels (shipped)
Cross-game progression that rewards *playing*, not just first-time achievements.
- **`xp.js`** — shared drop-in module (like `achievements.js`), loaded `defer` **after** it on every
  game + versus page (and `index.html` for display). Exposes `window.XP`. Self-contained (injects its
  own CSS). Persists to localStorage **`pl_xp`** `{xp}` (version-wiped via `pl_xp_ver`), syncs to the
  Google account (source of truth), and auto-wraps `Ach.unlock` so **every achievement also grants XP**
  (normal 40, challenge 120).
- **Curve:** XP to reach level `L` = `25·(L-1)·(L+2)` (L→L+1 costs 100, 150, 200, 250…). `RANKS` give a
  flavor title per band (Rookie Ball → Prospect → … → Immortal). No hard cap.
- **Earning** (`XP.award(amount, reason)`): finishing a build (`20 + max(0, ovr−60)`), simulating a
  career (`40 + 150 HOF + max(0, ovr−70) + 12·rings`, capped), a 1v1 result (win 55 / loss 18), and
  every achievement unlock. Awards inside one build **batch** (320ms) into a single animated run.
- **Gain animation — Pokémon-style (`.xp-hud`):** a bar slides up from the bottom and **fills** from
  where it last sat to the new total. `segments(from,to)` splits the gain at each level boundary, so a
  big award **fills → flashes/dings/level-number bumps + spark burst (`levelUp`) → wraps to empty →
  refills**, repeating for **every** level crossed in one go (0, 1, or many). `lastShownXp` tracks what
  the bar last rendered (so a cross-device restore or `{silent:true}` award never animates), and an
  `animBusy` guard queues XP that arrives mid-animation. All GSAP; degrades to an instant set if absent.
- **UI:** `XP.mount()` fills any `[data-xp-bar]` slot with the resting level chip + progress bar —
  dropped into each game's ☰ menu (under the account chip) and the versus **Stats** screen.
  `[data-xp-level]` slots get just the number.
- **Server:** `users.xp bigint` (auto-`ALTER`) + **`xpSync`** action in `api/account.js`. XP is
  **monotonic** — the account keeps `max(local, stored)`, so it follows the email across devices and
  can never drop. Same `reset`/`claim` semantics as `achSync` (guest XP is adopted only into an account
  with none yet). Sign-out zeroes the local copy (`XP.signOut()`).
- Same **trust-the-client** caveat as the leaderboard/Elo — XP is reported from the browser.

### 🔥 Last Night's Studs (shipped)
Daily real-MLB hot players — the "open the app the morning after" retention hook. Baseball only
(no NBA box-score source; hoops untouched).
- **`api/hot.js`** — `GET /api/hot` → `{ ok, gameDate, players:[{mlbamId, name, team, pos,
  type:'pitcher'|'batter', line, boost}] }`. Computes once per **US-Eastern day** on the first
  request (no cron): statsapi schedule → one boxscore per Final game → stud scoring (pitchers =
  Game-Score-ish, qualify ≥68; batters = HR-heavy points, qualify ≥20 or 2 HR / 4 H / 3 SB auto).
  Top 4 pitchers + 6 batters; **`boost` = 5–10** scaled by how big the night was. Cached in Neon
  `hot_players(serve_date PK, payload jsonb)`; statsapi failure → serves the most recent stored
  day; off-days/All-Star break walk back up to 5 days; a day with games still live (late
  west-coast) is skipped. Tune the scoring locally with **`node api/hot.js`** (prints the list,
  no DB needed).
- **`hotboard.js`** — drop-in module (landing + both baseball games, like xp.js): `window.Hot`
  (`ready`/`list()`/`get(mlbamId)`/`open()`), the bulletin-board overlay, auto-opens **once per
  local day** (`pl_hot_seen`), skipped when a `#hash` deep link is present. Fails silent — no
  list, no change. Landing page also has a "🔥 Last Night's Studs" banner (`hotCta`) + games have
  a ☰ `miHot` item.
- **In-game** (pitcher.html + build-a-batter.html, identical pattern): `HOT` map by `mlbamId`,
  `hotVersion(p)` = copy with **+boost on every rated attribute and ovr** (never height/Frame;
  intentionally uncapped past 99, same precedent as Judge's 108 power), `HOT_ODDS = 0.10`
  direct-landing roll in `randPitcher`/`randHitter`, and any normal land on a hot player swaps to
  the hot card — a stud is *always* boosted today. 🔥 tag on reel cards, 🔥 badge + "Last night:
  <real line>" on the landed panel. The Boost power-up stacks on top of the hot card (never
  downgrades).
- **Guardrails:** **free play only** — `dailyMode` short-circuits all hot logic so the seeded
  same-for-everyone Daily Challenge stream is byte-identical with or without a hot list
  (verified). Versus 1v1 untouched (its balance is separately tuned). Hot builds can post higher
  OVRs to the global leaderboard — accepted trade-off, revisit with the anti-cheat hardening.

### Name filter (slurs/profanity in user-chosen names — shipped)
**`namefilter.js`** — ONE shared blocklist module for browser (`window.NameFilter`, loaded
without `defer` on every page so inline scripts can use it) AND server
(`require('../namefilter.js')` in `api/score.js` + `api/account.js`). Evasion-resistant matching:
accents stripped, leetspeak mapped (`n1gg3r`), separators dropped (`n i g g e r`), repeated
letters collapsed (`Nigggggger`), l→i lookalikes. Hard slurs match as substrings; ambiguous terms
word-boundary only (so Nigeria/raccoon/therapist/Hancock/Scunthorpe stay legal). API:
`isClean(name)` / `bad(name)` / `clean(name, fallback)`.
- **Server = enforcement** (client checks are just friendlier UX): `POST /api/score` +
  `challengeSubmit` reject bad names (400 with a clear error); `action=names` (the franchise
  FA/rival feed — how one player's slur name used to reach everyone else's franchise) drops
  them; leaderboard GETs censor legacy rows to "Anonymous". `api/account.js` gates `save` +
  `clubCreate` (reject), guest names, handles (`handleClaim`/`handleCheck`/`handleFrom`), club
  roster snapshots, and pvp `oppName`/`winnerName` (neutral fallback).
- **Client**: build games gate `nameInput` at draft/career/submit (`nameGate()`); franchise gates
  team + club names AND retro-scrubs saved rosters/rivals/logs on every load (`scrubSaves()` —
  fixes saves polluted before the filter shipped) + filters the cached FA pool (`scrubPool`);
  versus pages gate the guest handle; social.js gates handle claiming. Also bundled into the iOS
  app (`ios-app/build-www.js` SCRIPTS list).
- **Legacy DB cleanup**: token-gated `nameScrub` action (dry-run by default; `apply:1` writes)
  purges bad names already stored in users/saves/scores/daily_scores/clubs/pvp tables:
  `curl -X POST .../api/account -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"action":"nameScrub","token":"<STATS_TOKEN>","apply":1}'`
- It's a blocklist — extend `HARD`/`WORD` in `namefilter.js` as new evasions show up (both
  browser and server pick the change up automatically since it's one file). Franchise clone
  pages regenerate from `franchise.html` via `gen-franchise-clones.js` as usual.

### Creator referral tracking (?ref= — shipped)
Influencer/creator attribution for marketing pushes. Hand a creator a link like
`https://goat-lab.app/?ref=koogs` (works on ANY page/deep link — `/pitching?ref=x`, etc.).
- **`ref.js`** — tiny drop-in loaded on every page right after `xp.js`. Captures `?ref=<code>`
  (2–32 chars `[a-z0-9_-]`, lowercased, last-touch wins) → localStorage `pl_ref` + a **30-day
  cookie `pl_ref`**, then scrubs the param from the address bar. Exposes `window.Ref.code()`.
- **Attribution is server-side via the cookie** (same-origin fetches carry it automatically —
  zero per-game code): `api/score.js` `refOf()` tags leaderboard submissions (`scores.ref`),
  daily-challenge runs (`daily_scores.ref`), and first-spin plays (table `ref_plays(ref, day, n)`).
  Columns/table auto-create in `ensure()`.
- **Report:** token-gated `GET /api/score?action=refStats&token=<STATS_TOKEN>[&days=90]` →
  per-code plays / builds (+ per-game split + avg OVR) / dailies / first–last seen.
- Campaign docs (creator target list, DM templates, plan) live in **`marketing/`**.

### Known caveat — anti-cheat
Scores are submitted from the browser; the server only clamps `ovr` 1–99 and name length, so the OVR
is currently trust-the-client. Harden later by recomputing OVR server-side from the submitted `build`
(re-implement `WEIGHTS` + `heightToRating` in `api/score.js`).

---

## Career simulation (shipped)

After the draft: **name the pitcher, pick a team, and "Simulate Career"** → a season-by-season
playthrough → verdict + a shareable career card. All in `index.html` (pure JS). The sim is
**deterministic — seeded from the build** (slot values + player names), so the same pitcher always
produces the same career (fair/shareable; not currently re-rollable).

### Engine — `simulateCareer(filled, finalOvr)`
Loops age 23 → retirement. Per-season rate stats come from the slot ratings (all tuned — change the
constants in `simulateCareer`, then sanity-check by extracting the inline `<script>` and running it
under Node):
- **K/9** ← Strikeout (dominant): `-0.5 + strikeout*0.145 + small velo/break`. ~97 rating ≈ **1.5 K/IP**
  (≈13.5 K/9).
- **BB/9** ← Command inverted. **HR/9** ← Ground Ball inverted. **BABIP** ← Defense/Break/Ground Ball.
- **Innings/year AND career length** ← **Stamina** (primary, + Frame). Low stamina → bullpen role,
  fewer innings, shorter career. So **a huge career K total requires high Strikeout AND high Stamina**
  (a K-specialist with no stamina tops out ~900 career K).
- **ERA** from a FIP core (`(13·HR + 3·BB − 2·K)/IP + 2.56`) adjusted by Clutch (strand) + BABIP.
- **WAR** ≈ (4.10−ERA)·(IP/200)·… **Wins** ← ERA + IP + random team-quality. **Rings/playoffs** ← Clutch.

### Balance (tuned — re-verify if you touch any formula)
- **Cy Young** = rare, competitive *probability* (you must beat the whole league): 90 OVR ≈ 1.3
  career Cy, 93+ get a real shot at multiples (capped sane via `cyElite`), 80 ≈ 0.
- **Hall of Fame** (`hallOfFame`): `hofScore` (WAR + hardware + milestones) ≥ 80, or career WAR ≥ 80.
  ~85 OVR ≈ 70% HOF, 80 ≈ 0–5%, below ~78 ≈ never.
- **Career K** realistic (career K/9 ~6.7–9; only durable elite builds approach the 3,000-K club).
  The strikeout/Cy/K-milestone thresholds are anchored to these K levels — **bump them together** if
  K scaling changes.

### Verdict tiers — `careerTier(t, ovr)`
🏆 **Hall of Fame** (earned in the sim; shows a vote-% + "first ballot" line) · **Hall of Pretty Good**
(OVR 80–85) · **Hall of Mid** (72–79) · **Hall of Not Good** (≤71).

### Playthrough UX (in the done panel)
- **Team pick** (all 30; `TEAM_NAMES`) tints the season rows + the card.
- **Headlines feed** beside the log (`seasonHeadlines`): debut, Cy Young, no-hitters/perfect games,
  World Series, league titles, injuries, milestone crossings, retirement.
- **Live ticker** — K / Wins / WAR climb each season; flash + headline on milestone crossings
  (1,000–5,000 K, 100/200/300 W).
- **HOF vote reveal**, **trophy case** (Cy / rings / All-Stars / no-nos / titles), and a **shareable
  career card** (`buildCard` — team-colored, full career line, verdict; built to screenshot).
- Season rows are labeled by **calendar year starting '26**; badges (CY / ★ / ERA Leader / K Title /
  NO-NO / PG / 💍) sit on their own line so the stat line never truncates. Log + headlines stack on
  phones (≤720px).

### Still open / ideas
- Leaderboard still ranks by **draft OVR**, not career → could add a career-score board (and a
  server-side re-sim would also close the anti-cheat hole). Optional **re-sim** toggle. Trades / free
  agency across teams. Player comp ("most similar to …"). Auto nickname from the build.

## Batting Lab (sibling game — LIVE)
Same game as Pitching Lab, translated to **hitters**. Single file `build-a-batter.html` (clone of
`index.html`). **Deployed** alongside the pitcher game (same Vercel project): live at
`pitchinglab.pitchergami.com/build-a-batter.html`, linked from the pitcher header via the
`#buildTab` "🛠️ Build a Batter" button (`index.html`).

- **Data:** `node fetch-batters.js` (clone of `fetch-data.js`, `is_hitter===true`) → `batters.json`
  (`{pool, prime, legends}`). `contact`/`power` = L/R averages and **can exceed 99** (Judge 108/114);
  this is intentional — ratings are NOT clamped (slotNumeric/slotDisplay pass raw values, like the
  pitcher game), so over-99 cards get the full OVR + slower-aging benefit.
- **Prime/Boost:** highest-OVR special card per player, **plus** synthesized Primes (+6) for MVP /
  Silver Slugger / Hank Aaron winners who lacked one (`fetch-batters.js` pulls the MLB awards API).
  Boost keeps the higher of Live-vs-Prime per stat, so it can never downgrade a rating.
- **Verdict:** Compiler bonus — counting-stat milestones (HR/H/RBI clubs) nudge the OVR-based verdict
  tier up, with a "🧮 Hall of Compilers" tier for absurd counting lines (`careerTier`/`milestoneBonus`).
- **7 slots** (down from 9 — no Fielding/Arm/Durability): Vision=`plate_vision` (Eyes),
  Power=`power` (Bat), Contact=`contact` (Hands), Speed=`speed` (Feet), Clutch=`batting_clutch`
  (Helmet), Discipline=`plate_discipline` (Head), Frame=**height** (Body, `heightToRating`).
- **Figure:** `batter-figure.png` + 7 `bat-seg-<key>.png` masks (PIL softmax, anchors in `SLOTS` ax/ay).
- **WEIGHTS:** 1.2× Contact/Power, 1.1× Discipline/Vision/Clutch, 1.0× Speed/Frame.
- **Sim** (`simulateCareer`, seed `|bat-career-v1`): OPS/FIP-style hitting model. Career length & PA
  ← **Frame** (replaced durability); defense (`defRuns`)/Gold Glove ← **Speed** (replaced Fielding/Arm).
  HOF via `hofScore` or `slamDunk`. Tuned: 99≈GOAT, 90≈100%, 85≈72%, 80≈23%, ≤77≈0%.
- **HR top-end (2026-07-10 retune of a retune):** over-99-power builds get HALF their headroom as
  the seasonal power cap + a small `superPow` slope/variance term; hrRate cap 0.078. Maxed
  (power-114) build = ~670 avg / ~734 max career HR, best seasons ~48 max — **~10% over the
  classic 614/647, on purpose; do NOT re-inflate** (the first cut hit 748/918 avg/max career +
  78-HR seasons and got rolled back). ≤99-power builds are byte-identical to the classic sim.
  Verify any change with a Node harness that extracts `simulateCareer` from the HTML (see the git
  history of this fix). `api/score.js` also strips impossible careers on submit (`CAREER_MAX` —
  keep in sync with verified sim maxima; re-based 2026-07-11 for hot-boosted builds under the
  soft-capped sims: batter hr>850/h>4250/rbi>3600/r>2300/sb>730, pitcher k>7100/ip>4650/wins>390)
  and has a token-gated `redactCareers` admin action (STATS_TOKEN) that stripped careers from the
  inflated window (criterion: Power slot > 99 + created_at ≥ 2026-07-10T05:37Z).
- **Over-99 soft-cap (2026-07-11, both sims):** the 🔥 hot boost stacks past 99 (card display is
  intentionally uncapped), but the SIMS soft-cap over-99 inputs. Pitcher `simulateCareer` routes
  every raw build-value read through `soft()` (keeps 40% of over-99 headroom — less than the
  batter's half because K rate × innings × career length compound): maxed all-109 = +14% avg /
  +10% max career K over all-99. Batter audit found hits/SB/runs/RBI already contained by the
  seasonal 99-clamps (+3.5%/+9%/+5%/+15% for a maxed hot build — in band, untouched); only
  `mvpElite` needed the soft-cap (raw over-99 OVR, same class as pitcher `cyElite`). ≤99 builds
  byte-identical in both games (harness-verified, 900 careers × 300 random builds each).
- **Leaderboard:** shared `api/score.js`, separated by `game` column (`pitcher`|`batter`, default
  `pitcher`, backward-compatible). **Live** — batter scores post to the same Neon DB / serverless
  function as the pitcher board.

---

## ⚠️ File structure (updated — older notes above are stale)
The repo is **NOT** a single `index.html` anymore. Current layout (routes in `vercel.json` rewrites):
- **`index.html`** = the **landing/router page** (hero, "Build a Pitcher/Batter" cards, Hard-Mode
  toggle, drifting "careers" bg, and a **top-right ☰ hamburger** with Google sign-in + nav). It is
  NOT the game.
- **`pitcher.html`** = the pitcher game, served at **`/pitching`**.
- **`build-a-batter.html`** = the batter game, served at **`/batting`**.
- **`versus.html`** = the **1v1 Face Off** mode, served at **`/versus`** (see below).
- **`college.html`** = College Football Lab (see section below), served at **`/college`** (+ `/cfb`).
- Hamburger items that are game-specific deep-link into the pitcher game via hash:

## College Football Lab (LIVE, v1) — `college.html` at `/college`, game key `cfb`
**Three positions in ONE page** (QB / RB / WR) — a position-select screen sets `POSITIONS[key]`
(slots/weights/figure/masks/stage aspect) into the `SLOTS`/`WEIGHTS`/`DATA` globals, then the
normal draft loop runs. Cloned from `build-a-baller.html` (build script pattern in git history).

- **Data:** `node fetch-cfb.js` (`--fresh` re-downloads) → `cfb.json` `{positions:{qb,rb,wr:
  {pool,prime}}, legends:{qb,rb,wr}, teams}`. Source = **CFB Labs' public GraphQL endpoint**
  (`cfblabs.com/.netlify/functions/cfb27-players`, full EA CFB27 default rosters — EA's own
  drop-api for CFB27 was empty at launch; filters endpoint gave the 41 crest PNGs saved in
  `cfb-filters-raw.json`). QBs are stored as `"QB (Right)"/"QB (Left)"`, RBs as `"HB"`. Pools
  (v2, per Matt): **Power-4 schools + ND only, floor 64, top 300 per position** (293 QB / 300
  RB / 300 WR — tune `POOL_FLOOR`/`POOL_CAP`/`P4_TEAMS`), synthesized Primes (+6/slot, ovr+5),
  12 hand-authored college icons per position (rated on their COLLEGE careers — Tebow 97).
  **Headshots + logos from ESPN** (`cfb-espn-raw.json`, deleted → re-downloads): rosters matched
  by mascot displayName, players by name with transfer-aware fallbacks (EA carries spring-2026
  portal moves ESPN lags — Lagway is a Bear; a globally-unique name match follows the face, not
  the school). ~48-65% of the pool, 70-90% of the top 30, get real faces; everyone else shows
  the school crest (`headshot()` → player img → crest → silhouette).
- **Slots (9 per position, 3× 1.2 / 3× 1.1 / 3× 1.0):** QB Short/Mid/Deep Accuracy premium; RB
  Speed/Break Tackle/Vision; WR Hands/Speed/Routes. RB's catch slot is labeled **"Catching"**
  (not "Hands") so the flat server `OVR_W.cfb` map has no cross-position weight collisions.
- **Figures:** 3 AI-generated silhouettes (`_cfb-<pos>-source.jpg`, committed) →
  `make-cfb-figures.py` (morphological-close before largest-component: thin white seams sever
  limbs; RB ground-shadow hard cut) → `make-cfb-masks.py` (Voronoi+feather, anchors in file).
  Stage aspects: QB 1086/1445 · RB 1086/1308 · WR 1086/1338 (set inline by `selectPosition`).
- **Career sim** (deterministic, seed `|cfb-career-<pos>-v1`): **Signing Day** ceremony (star
  rating + hat-grab reveal at the **build's modal school**, ties seeded), 3–5 seasons (≥88 OVR
  declares after junior year, <72 grinds 5), per-position stat lines, Heisman (QB-favored,
  ~0.5/career at 95) / natty / All-American, **NIL money** (= earnings), College-HOF legacy
  score, **NFL Draft projection** verdict line ("Going pro in something other than sports" at
  the bottom). Tiers: 🐐 College GOAT (2 Heismans, or H+natty at 98+) · 🏆 College Legend ·
  🏈 Hall of Stat-Stuffers · Campus Hero · Solid Saturday Starter · Hall of Walk-Ons.
  **Decision events (always on):** same halt-and-resume engine as the other games — separate
  `|cfb-decisions-v1` stream plans events with a FIXED draw count, picks consumed positionally,
  risk rolls pre-drawn (same picks → same career; don't break this). Pool = campus life (party,
  frat, roommate, midterms, mascot heist, spring break, the DM) + career (NIL bag, five-star
  position battle, rivalry mic, transfer portal → school actually changes mid-career, injury
  sit-or-play, junior-year declare-or-return where ⏩-skip defaults preserve classic lengths).
  `CFB_EVENTS` fx pills must mirror `applyChoice`.
  **CFP bracket (no flat title roll):** playoff seasons run a real 12-team bracket - seed from
  wins+prestige (1-4 = bye), per-game win prob from prestige/warScore/seed, opponents weighted
  to blue bloods, per-game player stat lines that count toward totals and feed headlines
  ("💔 CFP Semifinal: ..."). Natty ONLY by sweeping the run; losing the final = 🥈 runner-up
  (badge, trophy, +5 legacy; cfpWins +1.5 each). Tuned to match the old flat rates
  (95 OVR ≈ 1.4 natties/career, 85 ≈ 0.2) - re-verify with the harness if touched.
  Re-verify with a Node harness that extracts the sim from the HTML (see git history).
- **Server:** `'cfb'` in both `gameOf` whitelists; `api/score.js` has SLOT_MAX/OVR_W/LEGEND_CAP/
  CAREER_MAX (yds 17000 / td 170) + sort keys `yds/td/heisman/natty`. Leaderboard + Google
  sign-in + personal HOF fully live (`HOF_GAME='cfb'`, build payload carries `pos`).
- **Daily Challenge (LIVE):** the position ROTATES by date (3-day QB→RB→WR cycle,
  `dailyPosKey()`), so everyone worldwide builds the same position from the same seeded cards.
  `startDailyChallenge` forces `selectPosition(dailyPosKey())` before seeding. Shared cross-game
  streak; posts as game `cfb`; `/college#daily` + `#streak` deep links; hub + switcher route to it.
- **🏈 Go Pro / NFL continuation (LIVE):** optional second act — `goProBtn` on the verdict
  screen → Draft Night ceremony (same GSAP skeleton; UDFA variant: "the phone never rang") →
  `simulateNflCareer` (seed `|cfb-nfl-<pos>-v1`, deterministic). Draft stock = college resume +
  combine swing; a wide **destiny roll** makes ~10% of arcs true busts (proPeak craters) and
  late picks/UDFAs get chip-on-shoulder upside (💎 DRAFT STEAL when they reach Canton; UDFA
  without upside = 🎽 Cut in August, 0 seasons). Pro seasons append to the same career log
  (Y1/Y2 rows, NFL logos via a.espncdn.com, MVP/All-Pro/SB badges), ticker keeps accumulating,
  card gets an NFL strip (draft line, pro totals, trophies, verdict). Tuned: 95-OVR QB ≈
  1.1 MVP + 1.0 SB/career, HOF 89% (RB 23% / WR 54% — position-realistic), careers QB≈14yr /
  RB≈8 / WR≈10, earnings soft-capped $620M. College OVR/leaderboard untouched — NFL is legacy
  flavor; HOF saves carry a slim `nfl` block. Verdicts: 🐐 NFL GOAT · 🏆 Pro Football Hall of
  Fame · ⭐ Franchise Legend · Solid Pro · 🚨 First-Round Bust · Journeyman · 🎽 Cut in August.
- **v1 scope cuts (still open):** no ads (Playwire block stripped — read `ads.md` before
  re-adding), no achievements/xp/collection/quests/season-track/social/switcher modules on the
  page (no-op seams kept), no versus/franchise. Hub shows those as 🔒 coming soon.

## 1v1 "Face Off" mode (LIVE) — `versus.html` + `api/match.js` + `api/ably-token.js`
Live online PvP. Two real players match; one is randomly assigned **Pitcher**, the other **Batter**;
each **quick-builds** their guy under a shot clock; a seeded GSAP **at-bat** plays on both screens;
**higher Overall always wins** (tie → seeded coin). Entry points: a banner + ☰ item on `index.html`,
a `⚔️ 1v1 Live` ☰ item in both games, and the `/versus` route.

> **Real balance (22,959 matches, 2026-06-29): BATTER-favored ~53% / pitcher ~47%; avg build OVR
> pitcher 89.6 vs batter 90.2.** The old "pitcher ~54%" note (88 matches) was small-sample noise —
> the large sample shows batters win ~6 pts more because they build ~0.6 OVR higher. Check live via
> the `pvpMatchStats` curl below.
>
> **2026-06-29 pitcher-Defense fix (versus only):** pitcher `fielding_ability` was uniquely
> compressed/low (median 48 vs 60s–80s for every other slot), a guaranteed dead anchor. In
> `versus.html` we now (1) curve it onto the others' scale via `curvePitchDef` (median→~62, elite
> raw-70+ gloves → curved 95+) and (2) weight it via `defWeightP` (0.3 for average, ramps to ~1.2
> only for elite curved D). Applies to the **pitcher role only** — batter Defense is already the
> highest batter slot (median 70, well spread), so it's untouched. Sim: +0.9 avg pitcher OVR, which
> *helps* the underdog pitcher side. **Re-check `pvpMatchStats`** after post-fix games accumulate; if
> pitchers jump past ~53%, shave the `curvePitchDef`/`defWeightP` constants down.
>
> **2026-07-02 shave:** that happened — pitchers hit 54.4% reported (50k matches, avg OVR 90.8 vs
> 90.5). `curvePitchDef` shaved from `62 + (v-48)*1.5` to `60 + (v-48)*1.4` (≈ −0.3 avg pitcher
> OVR, the size of the gap); `defWeightP` untouched (shaving both overshoots batter-favored again).
> Re-check `pvpMatchStats` after post-shave games accumulate; expect pitcher-reported wins ~51–52%
> (reporting bias means it never reads exactly 50). Still high → drop the base to 58.

### ⚙️ Setup REQUIRED for a fresh deploy
- **`ABLY_API_KEY`** env var in Vercel (format `appId.keyId:keySecret`, mark **Sensitive**). Without
  it `/versus` matchmaking errors. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`/Neon are already set.
- **No `npm i ably`** — `api/ably-token.js` signs Ably TokenRequests with Node `crypto`; the browser
  loads Ably from CDN (`ably.min-2.js`) with `authUrl: '/api/ably-token'`.

### Realtime (Ably)
- One shared connection (`connectAbly` guarded by `ablyPromise`), reused by matchmaking AND the live
  ticker. **`echoMessages:false`** so your own published build doesn't come back as the opponent's
  (that caused an early "you vs you" bug; handlers also ignore `msg.clientId === clientId`).
- Channels: `versus:invite:<id>` (matchmaking hand-off), `versus:match:<matchId>` (in-match
  presence + `build`/`progress` messages), `versus:online` (global presence for the ticker).

### Matchmaking (`api/match.js`, table `pvp_queue`)
- Atomic claim: `DELETE … WHERE id = (SELECT … WHERE id<>me AND (pid IS NULL OR pid<>mypid) AND
  fresh ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)`. **`pid`** = `acct:<sub>` or
  `guest:<guestId>` → you can't match **yourself** on a 2nd tab/device. (To self-test, use one
  normal + one **incognito** window = different guestId.)
- Waiting is **push-based**: the claimer publishes the match to the waiter's `versus:invite:<id>`
  (waiter subscribed to its own channel) + a **3s retry** net so two simultaneous searchers still
  pair. Stale rows >60s swept; `leave` action + `navigator.sendBeacon` on `pagehide`; claimer
  re-queues after 8s if the opponent never shows.

### Quick-build (in `versus.html`)
- Per-role trimmed draft. **2-minute (120s) shot clock**; auto-fills remaining slots on timeout.
  Each open slot **previews the landed player's `+rating`**. Power-ups (one each): **Re-spin, Snag
  (L/R), Boost (Prime)**. **Grey tier excluded: `MIN_VERSUS_OVR = 65`** (`pool()` filters
  `DATA[role].pool` to `ovr >= 65`).
- Layout mirrors the normal game: **reel + Spin button on top**, then slots (tap to assign), then
  the figure (mobile-friendly; `build-grid` reordered).
- `ROLE` config object holds per-role `slots`/`weights`/`figure`/`h2r`(heightToRating)/`slotWeight`;
  `computeOvr` uses the same weights as each game. Role reveal shows a glowing team-colored
  **silhouette** (mask of the figure PNG) instead of an emoji.
- At-bat seed (`mulberry32`) drives identical flavor on both phones. **Wait-arena**: finishing first
  takes you to the arena — your glowing fighter ready, opponent's side greyed out + a **live
  progress bar** of their slots; 75s no-show → **"No Contest"** (no rating change).

### Elo + accounts (`api/account.js`)
- On `users` table: **`pvp_elo`** (start 1000), `pvp_wins`, `pvp_losses`, `pvp_streak`. Dedup table
  `pvp_results(match_id, google_sub)`.
- Each player updates **only their own** rating vs the opponent's reported `elo` (sent in the `build`
  message). **K=32**. **Win-streak bonus**: `+2` Elo per consecutive win, caps at a **5-win streak**
  (max +10); any loss resets. `nextElo()` + `STREAK_BONUS/STREAK_CAP`.
- **Guests are rated (no password):** device `guestId` + chosen `guestName` (localStorage
  `pl_guestId`/`pl_guestName`) stored in `users` under a **`guest:<id>`** key. **`pvpKey(body)`**
  resolves a request to a signed-in user OR a guest. The chosen **handle** (`guestName`) is the
  public display name everywhere (NOT the Google full name) — sent via `principal()` and saved as
  `users.name`.
- Actions: **`pvpStats`** (rating/record), **`pvpResult`** (apply result + Elo + streak + logs the
  match), **`pvpClaim`** (carry a guest rating onto a Google account on first sign-in, only if the
  account has 0 games), **`pvpLeaderboard`** (top by `pvp_elo` + the caller's rank).
- Sign-in is shared with the games via **`pl_account`** localStorage. **`login` now KEEPS the
  existing `session_token`** (`COALESCE(users.session_token, EXCLUDED…)`) instead of rotating it —
  fixes the "signed out moving between pages" bug (Google One-Tap auto-sign-in fired per page load
  and used to invalidate other tabs' tokens).

### Stats page + live ticker
- **Stats screen** (in `versus.html`): rating, worldwide rank, W/L/win-rate/games + **Top Players**
  leaderboard. Reachable from: 📊 button on matchmaking, 📊 on the result screen, and **`/versus#stats`**
  deep-link from all three hamburger menus.
- **Live ticker** on the matchmaking screen: `"X playing · Y waiting for a match"` driven by the
  `versus:online` Ably presence channel (every `/versus` visit joins on load; status =
  `idle`/`searching`/`playing`).

### Match logging + how to read win rates (table `pvp_matches`)
- Every finished match logs `(match_id, role, won, ovr, opp_ovr)` (anonymous). Read via the
  **token-gated `pvpMatchStats`** action: token = `STATS_TOKEN` env var, fallback hardcoded
  `'pl-balance-7f3a9c21'` in `api/account.js` (server-side only, safe).
- Check anytime:
  `curl -s -X POST https://pitchinglab.pitchergami.com/api/account -H "content-type: application/json"
  -d '{"action":"pvpMatchStats","token":"pl-balance-7f3a9c21"}'`

### Known caveats (1v1)
- **Trust-the-client**: OVR, Elo, and win/loss are reported from the browser (cheatable) — same class
  as the leaderboard caveat. Harden later by validating server-side.
- **Empty-lobby**: live-only matchmaking, no "ghost"/bot fallback — a lone player waits.
- All `pvp_*` tables + columns auto-create/`ALTER … IF NOT EXISTS` on first request (no migrations).
